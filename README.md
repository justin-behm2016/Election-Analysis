#### Election Audit Summary and Further Use
The script used to analyze this election is versatile and should be considered for additional use(s) moving forward. The current script can be used as a baseline as it was createed for this specific election. Changes to the script's candidates could lead to the script being applicable for other electoral races in the same election. After uploading a different voter CSV data file, switching the current candidate names to those running for other positions, such as House of Representatives, Treasury, etc., would result in a script being available to analyze this new data set. Additionally, changing the counties or adding to the existing list could broaden the scope in which this script applies. The script could be used to analyze a larger CSV file that encompasses more counties by adding the new counties and adjusting as necessary.
